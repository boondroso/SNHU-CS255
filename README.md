# SNHU-CS255
# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was for a company founded by Liam, who was the client. DriverPass wanted a web-based, cloud-hosted driver training and scheduling system. They needed the system to handle user registration, online courses, driving lesson scheduling, role-based access control (for students, instructors, and admins), user progress tracking, and integration with the DMV to help students get their driver's licenses.
# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I excelled in the creation of the activity designs. I clearly mapped out the key workflows users would follow, which made the system easier to design and build. This strong foundation kept the project organized and aligned with user needs.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the initial use case diagram. While it covered the main features, I realized later that I could have added more detailed relationships between the actors and the system, like including specific exceptions or alternate flows (for example, what happens if a student misses a scheduled lesson). To improve it, I would spend more time gathering detailed user scenarios and update the diagram to better capture all possible interactions, not just the most common ones.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took a close look at what the client wanted — things like online courses, lesson scheduling, and DMV integration — and made sure to build those into the system features. I put together things like a registration system and tools for booking lessons so it would match exactly what DriverPass needed. I also used UML diagrams (like use case and class diagrams) to lay out and organize how everything would work. At the end of the day, if a system doesn’t meet the user's needs, it doesn’t matter how good it looks — it’s not going to work. That’s why it's so important to really listen to users and make sure you're building something that’s easy to use and actually helpful.
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I start by gathering clear requirements, analyzing the user workflows, and breaking the system into smaller pieces. I created diagrams (like use case, sequence, or class diagrams) to organize my thoughts. Then I think about how users will interact with the system and how the back-end will support that.

Techniques or strategies I’d use in the future:
- User stories and personas to keep the real users in mind
- Prototyping to test ideas early
- Agile development, so I can adjust designs as new needs or feedback come up
